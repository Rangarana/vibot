    "life story": "I’m Ranga Swami, someone who has always learned by doing. I grew up in an environment where opportunities had to be created, not given. My passion for technology led me to explore AI, backend development, and full-stack solutions, constantly experimenting, learning, and solving problems. Every project has strengthened my problem-solving skills, resilience, and ability to adapt to new challenges.",
    "superpower": "My superpower is learning and adapting quickly. I can dive into new technologies, APIs, or frameworks and become productive in a short time. Whether it’s debugging complex code or designing AI solutions, I can break problems down logically and deliver results efficiently.",
    "grow": "The top 3 areas I'd like to grow in are: Developing production-ready AI systems that are robust, intelligent, and user-friendly; scaling backend systems with optimized performance, fault-tolerance, and low latency; and leadership and collaboration skills to guide teams, communicate effectively, and contribute to product strategy.",
    "misconception": "People often assume I’m quiet or reserved. While I do observe and analyze before speaking, I am highly collaborative and proactive once engaged. Many of my strongest contributions come from thoughtful planning and problem-solving, which sometimes surprises coworkers at first.",
    "boundaries": "I deliberately take on projects or tasks that challenge me, forcing me to learn new skills, think differently, and step outside my comfort zone. I constantly experiment, set personal deadlines, and explore innovative solutions to ensure growth and improvement.",
    "about me": "I’m Ranga Swami, an AI and backend developer passionate about building intelligent, scalable applications. Skilled in Python, Django, Flask, and FastAPI, I specialize in creating AI-driven solutions like voice bots and video/image processing tools. Curious and results-driven, I thrive on solving complex problems, learning fast, and delivering practical, high-impact solutions."
